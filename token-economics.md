# Token Economics

## Token Engineering Community

The [Token Engineering Community](http://tokenengineering.net) is the place where practitioners and academia gather to share, collect and discuss the most recent findings in Token Engineering and Tokenomics.

Definitely check out their [library](https://tokenengineeringcommunity.github.io/website/docs/library-welcome) for a curated list of useful Token Engineering resources. In addition to that you don't want to miss their [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/TokenEngineering/) which is a treasure trove for anyone interested in in-depth protocol analyses and tutorials.

## Ocean Protocol - Token Engineering Series

The team at Ocean Protocol put together an educational three part blog post series in which they walk the reader through all the stages involved in Token Engineering.

The series covers topics such as game theory, the incentive design behind Bitcoin, the process they've used to design the Tokenomics for Ocean protocol as well as various case studies and other deep dives.

## Yos Riady's Cryptoeconomics Articles

Yos Riady has published a number of in-depth [blog posts](https://yos.io/tag/cryptoeconomics/) on a variety of Token Economics related topics such as Bonding Curves, the Howey Test, Token Utility Models and more.

* [A Whirlwind Tour of Security Token Standards](https://yos.io/2018/10/31/security-token-standards/)
* [Bonding Curves Explained](https://yos.io/2018/11/10/bonding-curves/)

## Sam Williams: Mechanism Design 101

Sam Williams, the co-founder of Arweave held a lecture on incentive design in the context of the a16z Crypto Startup School.

In his [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCFlGLbI_kE), Sam deconstructs the underlying game theoretic constructs of Bitcoin and talks about Arweave's Tokenomics and the design decisions they had to take into account while implementing their protocol.

## Token Economics Resources List

The [Token Economics Resources List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_py70Ic2u91VILJWCA7AMOXVZmmTv-zGo-LPr3PhDvM/edit) is a massive Google Document with tons of useful links to dive deeper into the ins- and outs of Token Economics and Incentive Engineering.

It's content is updated regularly and various filters help you find the best content for your current needs.

**Protip**: While obvious to spreadsheet power users, don't miss the tabs for the different sheets at the bottom!

## Cryptoeconomics.Study

[Cryptoeconomics.Study](https://cryptoeconomics.study/) is a free, Open Source course which teaches you the fundamentals of Blockchain protocols and their underlying Token Economics.

Working through it you'll not only learn how Blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum work, you'll also get introduced to the game theoretic aspects which will help you understand why consensus mechanisms such as Proof-of-Work \(PoW\) and Proof-of-Stake \(PoS\) can be used to secure the network.

## Economics Design and Engineering for Robust DLT Ecosystems

If you're looking for a Token Economics design framework, you don't want to miss the "[Economics Design and Engineering for Robust DLT Ecosystems](https://www.economicsdesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Economics-Design-and-Engineering-for-Robust-DLT-Ecosystems-.pdf)" white paper authored by Lisa JY Tan.

Reading through it you'll learn about the "Token Economics Model" you can use to design the incentives and mechanisms for your Crypto project.

## Economics Design

[Economics Design](https://www.economicsdesign.com/) is a great resource to learn more about Tokenomics and Token Engineering. Browsing through their [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/EconomicsDesign/) you'll find in-depth analysis of existing Crypto projects, Explainers for concepts like "Bonding Curves" and the Mathematics behind Token Economics.

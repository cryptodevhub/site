# Getting Started

## 1. CryptoZombies

The best way to learn something new is through a structured curriculum which walks you through the big ideas and major concepts in a guided fashion. Ideally as frictionless as possible.

[CryptoZombies](https://cryptozombies.io/) is one of the best resources for every aspiring Ethereum dApp / Solidity developer. In it you'll build your own NFT-style Zombie game and learn all the important concepts of EVM development and the Solidity programming language. The best part is that it's completely browser based, so you don't need to install and configure anything.

While you can work through the whole course we'd advice to focus on the first 2 sections about Solidity Smart Contract development.

If you're interested in writing Smart Contracts with Vyper you should check out [Vyper.fun](https://vyper.fun/) which is another great interactive resource focused on the Vyper programming language.

## 2. Learn about Truffle Suite / Hardhat

While you can install and setup all the different toolings such as a Solidity / Vyper compiler from scratch doesn't mean you should.

Luckily enough others jumped in and built whole developer tool suites such as the [Truffle Suite](https://www.trufflesuite.com/) or [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/). Take some time to browse through both projects and play around with their solutions.

Once you're familiar with both, pick your favorite development stack and stick with it \(at least for the time being\). For beginners Truffle is usually the best choice as it comes with "batteries included". Intermediate / Advanced users will find more flexibility in Hardhat.

## 3. Build your first dApp

Given that you're now familiar with some basic Solidity / Vyper and the developer toolings in the Ethereum dApp space it's time to work on your first "real" project.

If you're already familiar with Software- and JavaScript Development in general you might want to jump straight into your own project without any further guidance. 

For others it might be worthwhile to follow an online tutorial like [this one](https://www.dappuniversity.com/articles/the-ultimate-ethereum-dapp-tutorial) from "Dapp University".

It isn't super important what you're building as long as you focus your efforts on writing code, rather than consuming more blog posts and YouTube videos.

## 4. Learn to use OpenZeppelin's Smart Contracts

Writing secure Solidity / Vyper code can be a tough endeavour. Luckily the folks at OpenZeppelin created and maintain a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts) with audited Smart Contract building blocks you can incorporate in your projects.

The full documentation for all the different Smart Contracts can be found [here](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts).

## 5. Get to know ERC standards

[ERC's](https://eips.ethereum.org/erc) are Ethereum Improvement Proposals in which different ideas to improve the Ethereum Blockchain are discussed. One of the most famous ERC's are ERC-20 and ERC-721, both of which describe Token standards.

Read through the ERC-20 and ERC-721 standards and build a dApp which leverages those.

**Protip**: OpenZeppelin's Smart Contracts package should help you in doing so.

## 6. Learn about Smart Contract Security

We already touched based on the importance of Smart Contract Security when it comes down to dApp and Blockchain development. Take some time to read through our [Security](https://wiki.cryptodevhub.io/ethereum-evm/security) page and learn more about recent hacks and potential pitfalls.

## 7. Join Communities

Learning never stops and is best nurtured via thoughtful discussions and working with others. Our [Communities](https://wiki.cryptodevhub.io/ethereum-evm/communities) page will show you all the Ethereum communities you might want to join.

You should also consider contributing back to your favorite Open Source projects \(or start your own\). Not only do you provide immediate value, working on Open Source is one of the best ways to solidify your knowledge and grow as an engineer.

## Bonus: Streamline your DX

While Truffle and Hardhat help you getting up to speed there's more tooling you can leverage to streamline your overall workflow and Developer Experience.

Paul Berg's [create-eth-app](https://github.com/PaulRBerg/create-eth-app) or Austin Griffith's [scaffold-eth](https://github.com/austintgriffith/scaffold-eth) are great projects which will help you getting started even faster.

You can find a more thorough list of useful tools on our [Tools](https://wiki.cryptodevhub.io/ethereum-evm/tools) page.

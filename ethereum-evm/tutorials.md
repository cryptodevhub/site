# Tutorials

## CryptoZombies

In [CryptoZombies](https://cryptozombies.io/) you'll learn Solidity, one of EVMs programming languages by building an NFT game in which you create, train and grow an army of Zombies.

Given its playful nature it's one of the best best introductions to the EVM and Solidity. While definitely interesting you might want to focus on the first two mini-courses and skip the "Beyond Ethereum" one when starting out.

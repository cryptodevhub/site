**Protip 1**: Given that Mythril's only requirement is EVM bytecode you can also use it to check your Smart Contracts for EVM compatible platforms such as the Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, Hedera or Tron.

**Protip 2**: For more advanced security analyses you can use the paid tool [MythX](https://mythx.io/). It includes Mythril, the fuzzer Harvey and the static analysis engine Maru. Work through the [MythX Apprentice Tutorial](https://mythx.io/mythxperts/apprentice/) to learn more about MythX and get rewarded with NFTs.

## Manticore

[Manticore](https://github.com/trailofbits/manticore) is a security tool which helps you uncover security vulnerabilities and unintended behavior by analyzing your Smart Contract and binary code.

It is a very powerful tool with lots of useful features such as:

- Automatic input generation to emulate a wide variety of real-world usage
- Program exploration which executes your code in various ways to reach any potential state it can be in
- Error discovery to uncover errors in development rather than production

**Protip 1**: Check out the [Manticore Examples](https://github.com/trailofbits/manticore-examples) repository for more involved, real-world CTF examples.

**Protip 2**: Use [Etheno](https://github.com/crytic/etheno) to simplify the setup of Manticore in large multi-contract projects.

## Echidna

[Echidna](https://github.com/crytic/echidna) is a fuzzing / property-based testing tool for Ethereum Smart Contracts. With Echidna you can generate random input data according to your Smart Contract ABIs.

This is very useful for automated tests as you don't have to come up with the assertions but Enchida does. Once a problem is found, Echidna lets you further shrink down the input domain to find an exact way to reproduce the issue.

**Protip**: Use [Etheno](https://github.com/crytic/etheno) to simplify the setup of Echidna in large multi-contract projects.

## Etheno

The [Etheno](https://github.com/crytic/etheno) project helps you integrate analysis tools such as Manticore and Echidna in large, multi-contract projects.

Its features include:

## Slither

[Slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) is a static analysis framework which lets you run vulnerability detectors to find exploitable code paths before deploying your Smart Contracts to production.

During execution it prints helpful, visual information to guide you through the bug-fixing process. It also comes with a programmable API so you can prototype and implement your own custom analyses.

## VerX

[VerX](http://verx.ch/) is an automated verifier able to prove custom functional properties of Ethereum Smart Contracts.

The functional properties for the contract are formalized in VerX specification language. By supplying VerX with the contract and the specification, VerX either verifies the property, outputs a sequence of transactions that may result in the property violation, or indicates that additional predicates are needed.

## Rattle

[Rattle](https://github.com/crytic/rattle) is a binary static analysis framework which works on Smart Contracts deployed on EVM-compatible Blockchains.

With Rattle you can recover the Smart Contract's original control flow graph to get an easier to read overview of the code you're about to interact with. When using Rattle, functions, their arguments as well as memory- and storage locations are recovered.

## Ethereum Security Toolbox

The [Ethereum Security Toolbox](https://github.com/trailofbits/eth-security-toolbox) is a project that provides a Docker container with preinstalled and preconfigured security tools such as Echidna, Etheno, Manticore, Slither, Rattle and more.

**Protip**: The Docker container also ships with the [\(Not So\) Smart Contracts](https://github.com/crytic/not-so-smart-contracts) repository so you can play around with the tools in a sandbox environment.

## Pyevmasm

[pyevmasm](https://github.com/crytic/pyevmasm) is an assembler and disassembler library for the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) written in Python. Using it you can assemble EVM instructions to opscode or disassemble opcodes back into EVM instructions.

The project includes the `evmasm` CLI as well as an API you can tap into via Python.

## Oyente

The [oyente](https://github.com/enzymefinance/oyente) tool by Enzyme Finance helps you analyze local and remote Smart Contracts. Using it you can verify contract assertions, generate the contracts function graphs, compute various statistics and scrape up-to-date transaction information.

## EVM Toolkit (etk)

The [etk](https://github.com/quilt/etk) project is a collection of tools for writing, reading and analyzing EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) bytecode. It ships with an assembler and disassembler which lets you write and explore EVM-based Smart Contract code.

**Protip**: The [etk book](https://quilt.github.io/etk/) teaches you everything you need to know to get up to speed with etk.

## Solidity Shell

[Solidity Shell](https://github.com/tintinweb/solidity-shell) is an interactive Solidity shell implementation with lightweight session recording and remote compiler support. It's written in JavaScript and requires Node.js and Ganache CLI to be installed on your local machine.

**Protip**: Read through the "Hints" and "Advanced usage" sections in the project's [README](https://github.com/tintinweb/solidity-shell/blob/master/README.md) to learn about various productivity hacks.

# Non-Fungible Tokens

## Generating Dynamic NFTs On-chain

The [Generating Dynamic NFTs On-chain Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS9xP1hxg3w) by Nader Dabit teaches you everything you need to know to create your own generative art NFT project.

During the course of this ~1 hour tutorial you will write your own ERC-721 contracts in Solidity and learn how you can use Chainlink's VRF (Verifiable Random Function) Oracle to introduce a trustworthy source of randomness.

## The Non-Fungible Token Bible

OpenSea's [Non-Fungible Token Bible](https://opensea.io/blog/guides/non-fungible-tokens/) is a long-form blog post that covers everything you need to know about NFTs.

Reading through it you'll learn the basics of NFTs, differences between token standards like ERC-721 and ERC-1155, the history of NFTs as well as background information about the Non-Fungible Token market.

## NFT School

The [NFT School](https://nftschool.dev/) is a community-driven website dedicated to cover all aspects of NFTs. Browsing through it you'll find resources to learn basic NFT concepts, in-depth tutorials as well as references and recommendations.

NFT School is an Open Source project so everyone is encouraged to update the website and contribute to the project.

## Building a Full Stack NFT Marketplace

This [blog post](https://dev.to/dabit3/building-scalable-full-stack-apps-on-ethereum-with-polygon-2cfb) written by Nader Dabit teaches you everything you need to know to build and launch your own EVM-based NFT Marketplace.

Working through it you'll use technologies like Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Solidity, Hardhat, Ethers.js and IPFS to create your own ERC-721 Smart Contract, publish the NFT to IPFS and display it via a frontend written in React.

The codebase for the project can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/dabit3/polygon-ethereum-nextjs-marketplace/). If you're a visual learner you can check out the accompanying [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKJBEEXUha0).

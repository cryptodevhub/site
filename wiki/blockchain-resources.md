## a16z Crypto Canon

Andreessen Horowitz \(a.k.a "a16z"\) created the [Crypto Canon](https://a16z.com/2018/02/10/crypto-readings-resources/) project which is an exhaustive list of Blockchain and Crypto resources. It's structured in a way of increasing complexity, meaning that the first readings are about Blockchain and Crypto basics whereas the later resources discuss topics such as Decentralized Exchanges, Consensus mechanisms and Governance.

While it was originally published in 2018 it's updated regularly, so you might want to bookmark and revisit it from time to time.

## a16z Crypto Startup School

The venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz \(know as "a16z"\) did a great job putting together a whole curriculum for aspiring Crypto startup founders called [Crypto Startup School](https://a16z.com/crypto-startup-school/).

In it you'll learn everything you need to know to build, launch and grow your project.

In conjunction to that they also published an article called "[The State of Crypto](https://a16z.com/2020/12/28/crypto-users-guide/)" which acts as a kind of TL;DR version of the Crypto Startup School content.

## Encode Club

The [Encode Club](https://www.encode.club) has some great [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8MwfizU_2GYh_LugWJom6A) in which various aspects of Blockchain Development and Crypto technologies are explained by industry experts. They consolidate all the resources via different tracks such as "DeFi Club" or "Hack the System". Simply click on the [playlists](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8MwfizU_2GYh_LugWJom6A/playlists) tab to get a sorted overview of their videos.

## Blockchain at Berkeley

Did you every attempt to read a Blockchain or Crypto whitepaper but got stuck halfway through? Are you looking for an easy to digest format for advanced Blockchain and Crypto topics such as "Layer 2 Scaling"? Chances are that the folks at "Blockchain at Berkeley" already covered and discussed this topic on the [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/BlockchainatBerkeley).

## Outlier Ventures

[Outlier Ventures](https://outlierventures.io), a "custom accelerator for Web 3" has a very helpful [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/OutlierVentures) where Web 3 founders present and discuss concepts such as the Metaverse, DeFi or NFTs in great detail.

## How does a Blockchain actually work?

The video "[But how does bitcoin actually work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4)?" by Grant Sanderson \(a.k.a 3Blue1Brown\) is a great visual introduction to Blockchains and their inner workings.

In it, Grant builds up the intuition behind Blockchains by slowly introducing and explaining the individual constituents and the math governing them and the whole system. Once you've watched it you should have a solid understanding how real world projects like Bitcoin, Ethereum or Cosmos work behind the scenes.

## Blockchain Demo

The [Blockchain Demo](https://blockchaindemo.io/) project by Sean Han is an interactive website which teaches you how a Blockchain works in an intuitive, bite-sized fashion.

Working through the tutorial you start with the genesis block to which you slowly add more data and hence blocks to the Blockchain. You'll explore why the chain forms a tamper-proof ledger, how a Peer-to-Peer network is formed to exchange blocks and how consensus is reached within such network based on protocols like Proof-of-Work.

With every step of the way you can look into the code underlying the implementation. The full [source code](https://github.com/seanjameshan/blockchain) can be found at GitHub.

There's also another, interactive [Blockchain tutorial](https://andersbrownworth.com/blockchain/) by Anders Brownworth you might want to look into as well. The implementation of such project is also [available at GitHub](https://github.com/anders94/blockchain-demo).
